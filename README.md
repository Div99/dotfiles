### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamjstewart/dotfiles.git
```

Then, all you have to do is source the bootstrap script:

```bash
source dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
```

To update your local repository with any changes I've made, just source the bootstrap script again.
