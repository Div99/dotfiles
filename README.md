# dotfiles

My personal Linux and macOS configurations and settings


## Installation

:warning: **Warning:** Installing my dotfiles will overwrite your old dotfiles. If you have any dotfiles in your home directory, back them up before doing anything else. That way you can revert to your old settings if you want to.


### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamjstewart/dotfiles.git
```

Then, all you have to do is source the bootstrap script:

```bash
source dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
```

To update your local repository with any changes I've made, just source the bootstrap script again.
